			<p>Delhi, officially known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), has been India’s capital since 1911. It is a “union territory,” which means the city is ruled by the central (federal) government. Delhi is the second wealthiest city in India after Mumbai, with a total wealth of $450 billion and home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires. </p>
			<p>The city has been constantly occupied since around 6 BC. It is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Delhi has served as the capital for many dynasties, including the Tughlaqs, the Khiljis, and the Mughals. </p>
